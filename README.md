This repo contains boilerplate code for a d3 viz.

First, install the packages:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To start developing run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

You should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "D3 Boilerplate" in http://127.0.0.1:8080.

From there, you start to develop your own code in the `app` directory. When you finish coding, use `npm run build` or `npm run deploy` to build the static files.
